The four different viewport units are:  vw (viewport width): 10vw would be 10% of the viewport's width. vh (viewport height): 3vh would be 3% of the viewport's height. vmin (viewport minimum): 70vmin would be 70% of the viewport's smaller dimension (height or width). vmax (viewport maximum): 100vmax would be 100% of the viewport's bigger dimension (height or width). Here is an example that sets a body tag to 30% of the viewport's width.  body { width: 30vw; }
<style>
h2 { width: 80vw; }
 p { width: 75vw; }
</style>
